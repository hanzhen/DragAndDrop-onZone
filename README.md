Drag And Drop into zones
================

I try to use [different libraries](https://github.com/search?l=Objective-C&q=drag+and+drop) in order to achive my goal.

As nothing fitted me need properly so I created my own component from scratch.



1 - What it does
---------
You have on your left a scrollable view of dragable view.
On your left you have few "zone" where you can drop this views.

By draging a view from the scrollable view will make it leave it scroll view.
Droping the view into a zone will move it into the zone.


2 - How to use
---------
TODO
